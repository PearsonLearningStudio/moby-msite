Moby mSite
================

The Moby mSite is a Pearson LearningStudio initiative aimed at providing a Mobile Solution
for our partners.  While the mSite is a working mobile experience, we are giving you access
to the source code so that you can customize your user experience to best suit your
student/faculty needs.

Online Javadoc is available at: [msite-js][msite-js]
